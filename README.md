#### 01. ***What is Node.js?***
Node.js is an open-source server side runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It provides an event driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side applications using JavaScript.

#### 02. ***What is Node.js Process Model?***
Node.js runs in a single process and the application code runs in a single thread and thereby needs less resources than other platforms. All the user requests to your web application will be handled by a single thread and all the I/O work or long running job is performed asynchronously for a particular request. So, this single thread doesn't have to wait for the request to complete and is free to handle the next request. When asynchronous I/O work completes then it processes the request further and sends the response.

#### 03. ***What are the data types in Node.js?***
**Primitive Types**  
* String 
* Number 
* Boolean 
* Undefined 
* Null 
* RegExp 
* **Buffer**: Node.js includes an additional data type called Buffer (not available in browser's JavaScript). Buffer is mainly used to store binary data, while reading from a file or receiving packets over the network.

#### 04. ***How to create a simple server in Node.js that returns Hello World?***
**Step 01**: Create a project directory
```
cmd> mkdir myapp
cmd> cd myapp
```
**Step 02**: Initialize project and link it to npm
```
npm init
```
This creates a `package.json` file in your myapp folder. The file contains references for all npm packages you have downloaded to your project. The command will prompt you to enter a number of things.
You can enter your way through all of them EXCEPT this one:
```
entry point: (index.js) 
```
Rename this to:
```
app.js
```
**Step 03**: Install Express in the myapp directory
```
npm install express --save
```
**Step 04**: app.js
```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
});
```
**Step 05**: Run the app
```
node app.js
```

#### 05. ***How do Node.js works?***
Node is completely event-driven. Basically the server consists of one thread processing one event after another.

A new request coming in is one kind of event. The server starts processing it and when there is a blocking IO operation, it does not wait until it completes and instead registers a callback function. The server then immediately starts to process another event (maybe another request). When the IO operation is finished, that is another kind of event, and the server will process it (i.e. continue working on the request) by executing the callback as soon as it has time.

So the server never needs to create additional threads or switch between threads, which means it has very little overhead. If you want to make full use of multiple hardware cores, you just start multiple instances of node.js

Node JS Platform does not follow Request/Response Multi-Threaded Stateless Model. It follows Single Threaded with Event Loop Model. Node JS Processing model mainly based on Javascript Event based model with Javascript callback mechanism.  
  
**Single Threaded Event Loop Model Processing Steps:**    
* Clients Send request to Web Server.
* Node JS Web Server internally maintains a Limited Thread pool to provide services to the Client Requests.
* Node JS Web Server receives those requests and places them into a Queue. It is known as “Event Queue”.
* Node JS Web Server internally has a Component, known as “Event Loop”. Why it got this name is that it uses indefinite loop to receive requests and process them. 
* Event Loop uses Single Thread only. It is main heart of Node JS Platform Processing Model.
* Even Loop checks any Client Request is placed in Event Queue. If no, then wait for incoming requests for indefinitely.
* If yes, then pick up one Client Request from Event Queue
    * Starts process that Client Request
    * If that Client Request Does Not requires any Blocking IO Operations, then process everything, prepare response and send it back to client.
    * If that Client Request requires some Blocking IO Operations like interacting with Database, File System, External Services then it will follow different approach
        * Checks Threads availability from Internal Thread Pool
        * Picks up one Thread and assign this Client Request to that thread.
        * That Thread is responsible for taking that request, process it, perform Blocking IO operations, prepare response and send it back to the Event Loop
        * Event Loop in turn, sends that Response to the respective Client.

#### 06. ***What is an error-first callback?***
The pattern used across all the asynchronous methods in Node.js is called *Error-first Callback*. Here is an example:
```javascript
fs.readFile( "file.json", function ( err, data ) {
  if ( err ) {
    console.error( err );
  }
  console.log( data );
});
```
Any asynchronous method expects one of the arguments to be a callback. The full callback argument list depends on the caller method, but the first argument is always an error object or null. When we go for the asynchronous method, an exception thrown during function execution cannot be detected in a try/catch statement. The event happens after the JavaScript engine leaves the try block. 

In the preceding example, if any exception is thrown during the reading of the file, it lands on the callback function as the first and mandatory parameter.

#### 07. ***What is callback hell in Node.js?***
`Callback hell` is a phenomenon that afflicts a JavaScript developer when he tries to execute multiple asynchronous operations one after the other.

An asynchronous function is one where some external activity must complete before a result can be processed; it is “asynchronous” in the sense that there is an unpredictable amount of time before a result becomes available. Such functions require a callback function to handle errors and process the result.
```javascript
getData(function(a){
    getMoreData(a, function(b){
        getMoreData(b, function(c){ 
            getMoreData(c, function(d){ 
	            getMoreData(d, function(e){ 
		            ...
		        });
	        });
        });
    });
});
```
**Techniques for avoiding callback hell**    

1. Using Async.js
1. Using Promises
1. Using Async-Await
* **Managing callbacks using Async.js**  
`Async` is a really powerful npm module for managing asynchronous nature of JavaScript. Along with Node.js, it also works for JavaScript written for browsers.

Async provides lots of powerful utilities to work with asynchronous processes under different scenarios.
```
npm install --save async
```
* **ASYNC WATERFALL**  
```javascript
var async = require('async');
async.waterfall([
    function(callback) {
        //doSomething
        callback(null, paramx); //paramx will be availaible as the first parameter to the next function
        /**
            The 1st parameter passed in callback.
            @null or @undefined or @false control moves to the next function
            in the array
            if @true or @string the control is immedeatly moved
            to the final callback fucntion
            rest of the functions in the array
            would not be executed
        */
    },
    function(arg1, callback) {
        //doSomething else
      // arg1 now equals paramx
        callback(null, result);
    },
    function(arg1, callback) {
        //do More
        // arg1 now equals 'result'
        callback(null, 'done');
    },
    function(arg1, callback) {
        //even more
        // arg1 now equals 'done'
        callback(null, 'done');
    }
], function (err, result) {
    //final callback function
    //finally do something when all function are done.
    // result now equals 'done'
});
```
* **ASYNC SERIES**  
```javascript
var async = require('async');
async.series([
    function(callback){
        // do some stuff ...
        callback(null, 'one');
        /**
            The 1st parameter passed in callback.
            @null or @undefined or @false control moves to the next function
            in the array
            if @true or @string the control is immedeatly moved
            to the final callback fucntion with the value of err same as
            passed over here and
            rest of the functions in the array
            would not be executed
        */
    },
    function(callback){
        // do some more stuff ...
        callback(null, 'two');
    }
],
// optional callback
function(err, results){
    // results is now equal to ['one', 'two']
});
```
* **Managing callbacks hell using promises**  
Promises are alternative to callbacks while dealing with asynchronous code. Promises return the value of the result or an error exception. The core of the promises is the `.then()` function, which waits for the promise object to be returned. The `.then()` function takes two optional functions as arguments and depending on the state of the promise only one will ever be called. The first function is called when the promise if fulfilled (A successful result). The second function is called when the promise is rejected.

```javascript
var outputPromise = getInputPromise().then(function (input) {
    //handle success
}, function (error) {
    //handle error
});
```
* **Using Async Await**  
Async await makes asynchronous code look like it’s synchronous. This has only been possible because of the reintroduction of promises into node.js. Async-Await only works with functions that return a promise.
```javascript
const getrandomnumber = function(){
    return new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve(Math.floor(Math.random() * 20));
        }, 1000);
    });
}

const addRandomNumber = async function(){
    const sum = await getrandomnumber() + await getrandomnumber();
    console.log(sum);
}

addRandomNumber();
```

#### 08. ***What are Promises in Node.js?***
It allows to associate handlers to an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise for the value at some point in the future.

Promises in node.js promised to do some work and then had separate callbacks that would be executed for success and failure as well as handling timeouts. Another way to think of promises in node.js was that they were emitters that could emit only two events: success and error.The cool thing about promises is you can combine them into dependency chains (do Promise C only when Promise A and Promise B complete).

The core idea behind promises is that a promise represents the result of an asynchronous operation. A promise is in one of three different states:

* pending - The initial state of a promise.
* fulfilled - The state of a promise representing a successful operation.
* rejected - The state of a promise representing a failed operation.
Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, it is immutable (i.e. it can never change again).  

**Creating a Promise**
```javascript
var myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
   ....
})
```

#### 10. ***When should you npm and when yarn?***
* **npm**  
It is the default method for managing packages in the Node.js runtime environment. It relies upon a command line client and a database made up of public and premium packages known as the the npm registry. Users can access the registry via the client and browse the many packages available through the npm website. Both npm and its registry are managed by npm, Inc.
```
node -v
npm -v
```

* **Yarn**  
Yarn was developed by Facebook in attempt to resolve some of npm’s shortcomings. Yarn isn’t technically a replacement for npm since it relies on modules from the npm registry. Think of Yarn as a new installer that still relies upon the same npm structure. The registry itself hasn’t changed, but the installation method is different. Since Yarn gives you access to the same packages as npm, moving from npm to Yarn doesn’t require you to make any changes to your workflow.
```
npm install yarn --global
```

**Comparing Yarn vs npm**    
* Fast: Yarn caches every package it downloads so it never needs to again. It also parallelizes operations to maximize resource utilization so install times are faster than ever.
* Reliable: Using a detailed, but concise, lockfile format, and a deterministic algorithm for installs, Yarn is able to guarantee that an install that worked on one system will work exactly the same way on any other system.
* Secure: Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package before its code is executed.
* Offline Mode: If you've installed a package before, you can install it again without any internet connection.
* Deterministic: The same dependencies will be installed the same exact way across every machine regardless of install order.
* Network Performance: Yarn efficiently queues up requests and avoids request waterfalls in order to maximize network utilization.
* Multiple Registries: Install any package from either npm or Bower and keep your package workflow the same.
* Network Resilience: A single request failing won't cause an install to fail. Requests are retried upon failure.
* Flat Mode: Resolve mismatching versions of dependencies to a single version to avoid creating duplicates.
